    "QuantConnect Alpha Streams allows quantiative funds to search a database of algorithm authors; and instantly license the authors' strategies (`Alpha`). The license agreements and fee structure is already prenegotiated, and the standardized backtesting and live trading infrastructure can give funds confidence in the algorithm results. Upon licensing an Alpha the insights/signals are instantly delivered to the fund in realtime."
